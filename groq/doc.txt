Project: Web-Based Loader for Real-time Application Generation (RAG) using Groq with DataStax and Cassio, Langchain

We will utilize the WebBaseLoader library to load data from the website.
With the assistance of the WebBaseLoader library, we will read the entire content.
After reading the data, it will be divided into chunks based on token size. These chunks will be used in embedding techniques.
We will convert these chunks into vectors using embedding techniques such as Ollama embedding and OpenAI embedding.
Since website content can be very large, resulting in a considerable number of vectors, we will need to store them. This process, known as vector storage, will be implemented using Astra DB.
Astra DB will be employed to store the vector data.
Using Cassio, we will establish a connection to Astra DB.
This connection will enable us to query any required data specifically.
