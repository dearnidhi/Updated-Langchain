Project: Langchain Series - Advanced RAG Q&A Chatbot with Chain and Retrievers Using Langchain

We start with a dataset collected from various sources such as PDFs, Excel sheets, and websites.
The dataset is loaded using different data ingestion techniques available in Langchain.
Transformation is applied to the dataset, where larger PDFs are broken down into manageable chunks.
Chunks are converted into vectors and stored in a vector store.
Utilizing prompts and specific data selection techniques, we employ the concept of Chain and Retriever.
In the advanced RAG pipeline, we use the LLM model within the Chain and Retriever framework.
Based on the prompt provided, we extract the desired information.
